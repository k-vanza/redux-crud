//here we define the action type we can have actions like making a request and it can have success or failure of request
//First we make the request and request failure part
export const MAKE_REQUEST='MAKE_REQUEST'
export const FAIL_REQUEST='FAIL_REQUEST'

//now we need the table data 
export const GET_USER_LIST='GET_USER_LIST'

//now once this action types are defined we need to return them inside of the action.js
